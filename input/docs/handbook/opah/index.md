# ObservableAsPropertyHelper

    Ryan:09:34 whenany -> OAPH is one of the most common patterns so maybe we talk about it more here? otherwise there's no dedicated section yet
    Geoff:09:34 We should talk about OPAH here in detail and then OPAH again in detail in it's own section.
    Geoff:09:34 Repetition is key in learning.
    Geoff:09:34 Or maybe introduce OPAH here in WhenAny* then next section that follows is OPAH in detail.
    Geoff:09:35 Repetition and slow introduction of concepts in sequential (logical) order.
    Ryan:09:35 yeah
    Ryan:09:35 like that
    Geoff:09:36 Should the section be called ObservableAsPropertyHelper or ToProperty
    Ryan:09:36 in the dedicated OAPH we can show chaining out of command results etc.
    Geoff:09:36 I think ObservableAsPropertyHelper, ToProperty is covered in WhenAny
    Ryan:09:36 hmmmmmm
    Ryan:09:36 yeah
    Ryan:09:36 toproperty is just one way to get an OAPH
    Ryan:09:36 it might be the only _real_ way
    Ryan:09:37 but i think the topic is OAPH yeah
    Ryan:09:37 maybe it can be - OAPH (Derived properties) or something like that
    
    
Goals:
* OPAH is the foundation of a reactive application.
