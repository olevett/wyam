# Events

That **reactiveui-*-events** packages have no adherence to ReactiveUI per-se, you can do RxUI without them, and you can use them without RxUI. They're simply "generated extension methods for every type exposing .NET events to expose corresponding `IObservable<TEventArgs>` wrappers", to save you the burden of writing the `FromEvent`/`FromEventPattern` yourself.

The events packages are generated by [a Moustache template](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/blob/master/ReactiveUI.Events/Events.mustache)  and [console app + ruby script](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/blob/master/ReactiveUI.Events/generate_events.rb).
