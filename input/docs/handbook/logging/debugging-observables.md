### Debugging Observables

ReactiveUI has several helpers for debugging IObservables. The most
straightforward one is `Log`, which logs events that happen to an Observable:

```cs
// Note: Since Log acts like another Rx operator like Select or Where,
// it won't do anything by itself unless someone Subscribes to it.
this.WhenAny(x => x.Name, x => x.Value)
    .SelectMany(async x => GoogleForTheName(x))
    .Log(this, "Result of Search")
    .Subscribe();
```

Another useful method to debug Observables is `LoggedCatch`. This method works
identically to Rx's `Catch` operator, except that it also logs the exception
to the Logger. For example:

```cs
var userAvatar = await FetchUserAvatar()
    .LoggedCatch(this, Observable.Return(default(Avatar)));
```
