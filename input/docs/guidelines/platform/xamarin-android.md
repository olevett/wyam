# Xamarin Android

## Navigation

Since native Android doesn't support ViewModel based routing, you have to use View based navigation instead. That means that you will do as much logic as possible in the ViewModel, but the navigation in the view using intents.
If you have other projects, for example a UWP, you want to use the view based navigation there aswell.
